# Glucose Level Prediction

## Overview
This repository provides an easy-to-run pipeline for predicting blood glucose levels using machine learning techniques. The model explores relationships between **Alpha-Amylase** and **Electric Resistance** to estimate glucose levels accurately.

## Features
- Machine learning-based prediction of blood glucose levels
- Simple and efficient pipeline implementation
- Command-line execution for ease of use

## Installation
Before running the pipeline, ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary dependencies. You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To execute the prediction pipeline, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python pipeline.py
```

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `torch`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
